# Library

I wrote this project as an assignment for COMP4004 Quality Assurance at Carleton University. 

It is based on the TOTEM system described in the paper "A UML-Based Approach to System Testing".

The Library is complete with an SQL datanase and a GUI. It could be used realistically in a setting where customer loans and late fees, as well librarian administration are necessary.
